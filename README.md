## 📋 Project Description

This is a **basic calculator web application** that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations. The calculator supports:

- Number input (0–9)
- Arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Result evaluation using the `=` button
- Clear functions: `CE` (Clear Entry), `x` (Backspace)

## 🧮 Features

- Full numeric keypad (0–9)
- Operator buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus
- `=` button to evaluate expressions
- `CE` button to clear the input completely
- `x` button to delete the last character (like backspace)
- Input and output displayed in a single text box

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for creating the structure of the calculator
- **CSS** – for styling the calculator layout
- **JavaScript** – for handling button click events and performing calculations

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Users click on number and operator buttons to build an arithmetic expression.
2. The input is displayed in the top text box.
3. When the user presses the `=` button, the result is calculated and displayed in the same input/output field.
4. The `CE` button clears the entire expression.
5. The `x` button removes the last entered character.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Understand DOM manipulation in JavaScript
- Learn how to build interactive UI elements
- Handle basic user input and math logic using event listeners
- Create a real-time calculator interface

## 📸 UI Layout Reference

The layout is based on the calculator sketch labeled **My Calculator** in the whiteboard image. It includes:
- A single input/output display box
- Buttons arranged in a calculator format
- Functional logic wired to button events

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

Project/
│
├── index.html # Structure of the calculator
├── style.css # Styling and layout
└── script.js # Logic and functionality

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Use the calculator by clicking the on-screen buttons.


## ⚠️ Limitations

- Only handles basic expressions (no parentheses or decimals yet)
- Uses `eval()` — can be replaced with a safer parser in future
- No keyboard input support (mouse clicks only)


## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add keyboard support
- Add decimal support and validation
- Improve design with responsive layout
- Add memory buttons (M+, M-, MC, MR)
- Replace `eval()` with a custom expression parser
